# ld50 - Farming until bankruptcy

My game submission for the Ludum Dare #50 Compo "Delay the inevitable".

[Ludum Dare Entry](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/50/farming-until-bankruptcy)

The initial Ludum Dare entry version is tagged with [v1.0.0](https://github.com/atomicptr/ld50/tree/v1.0.0), I added a few more changes to accommodate feedback I received.

## Description

You're a farming bunny deep in the red, hop around, farm as much as you can and try to delay your inevitable bankruptcy!
